Our project takes a methodical and thorough approach to guarantee accurate champagne sales predictions. Carefully preparing the data is the initial step, where we load past sales information for the champagne industry. To preserve the integrity and dependability of the time series in our dataset, this data has been carefully selected to handle any values that are missing and outliers. We clean up the data using methods like imputation and outliers’ removal so that the time series format remains consistent with date-time indexing. This preliminary stage is essential because it lays the groundwork for meaningful and reliable model training and assessment.
After preparing the data, we go on to the model's training and evaluation phase, where we use three different forecasting models: LSTM, SARIMA, and ARIMA. First, the ARIMA model is used, which is well-known for its ability to capture non-seasonal patterns of time series data. Using sophisticated methods such as grid search, we improve each of the model's variables (p, d, q) to make sure our ARIMA model is precisely calibrated to the complexities of champagne sales patterns. To take into consideration the innate seasonal trends found in champagne sales data, we also concurrently present a Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model. Seasonal variables (P, D, Q, and m) are incorporated into the SARIMA model to offer a more sophisticated and precise forecasting capability, which is especially important in industries with clear seasonal fluctuations.
Concurrently, we explore the domain of deep learning by utilizing an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. Champagne sales forecasting problems using time series data are a good fit for the LSTM model because of its exceptional ability to capture complex patterns and long-term connections within sequential data. We preprocess the data by standardizing the values and generating sequences with lagged parameters and seasonal indicators before feeding it into the LSTM model. By doing this preprocessing step, you can make certain that the LSTM model's predictions can accurately predict future periods and learn from past sales patterns.
Our study has shown that sophisticated time series forecasting models—such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM—are useful in projecting Champagne sales and other datasets as well. The most accurate and dependable model for sales prediction tasks was found to be the LSTM model with enhanced architecture after a thorough study and comparison utilizing important metrics including MSE, RMSE, and MAE. The potential of utilizing state-of-the-art technology in sales forecasting applications has been demonstrated using complex deep learning algorithms along with extensive data pretreatment and model tuning. These results highlight the value of data-driven approaches in corporate operations and offer insightful information to decision-making processes in sales and inventory management.
